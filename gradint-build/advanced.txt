# ---------- ADVANCED OPTIONS ------------

# This file contains several sections; you will have to
# scroll down to see all of them.  Each section starts with
# a header between lines of dashes    ---- like this ----

# ------- Options for learning multiple languages ---------

# otherLanguages below is a list of auxiliary languages
# (other than your first and second languages)
# that you want to learn some phrases in.
# The same abbreviations are used as with
# the 1st-language/2nd-language settings.

otherLanguages = ["cant","ko","jp"]

# Note 1: Unfortunately the GUI screens cannot yet show
# the auxiliary languages, unless you temporarily
# change your first/second languages and
# change them back again afterwards.  But they
# will be used in lessons if you have suitable words
# in your collection.
# No harm is done by including your firstLanguage and
# secondLanguage in the otherLanguages list as well,
# which can be useful if you frequently need to change.

# Note 2: For each auxiliary language you learn,
# you will need to tell Gradint how to say the
# name of that language.  For example, you can put
# files cant_en.txt, cant_zh.wav and cant_cant.wav in
# the prompts directory, to tell Gradint
# how to say the name of the "cant" language in en, zh or cant
# (you don't need all of them, but should at least
# have one in your first or second language).
# Some have been supplied already, but if
# you add new languages you'll need to do this.

# possible_otherLanguages (below) is a list of POSSIBLE
# auxiliary languages.  This should list all the auxiliary
# languages for which you have prompt files in the prompts
# directory, even if you don't want to learn them.  For
# example if you have cant_en.wav as described above, and
# later remove "cant" from otherLanguages to temporarily
# disable that language, you need to ensure that "cant" is
# in possible_otherLanguages, otherwise gradint will not be
# able to tell the difference between cant_en.wav and an
# ordinary English prompt and might use it wrongly.

possible_otherLanguages = ["cant","ko","jp","en","zh"]

# You can also fill in otherFirstLanguages below
# (using the same ["item","item"] format) to
# specify which of the otherLanguages you want to
# be treated as auxiliary "first" languages.
# For example, if your first language is Cantonese
# and you are learning English, but you also speak
# good Mandarin and have some Mandarin-to-English recordings,
# then it makes sense to set your first language
# to "cant", second to "en", and otherFirstLanguages=["zh"]
# and Gradint will then know that both Cantonese->English
# and Mandarin->English are acceptable
# (whereas if you just set otherLanguages=["zh"] then
# you'll get Cantonese->English and Cantonese->Mandarin)

otherFirstLanguages = []

# You can also add lines in vocab.txt that say
# "SET LANGUAGE" followed by a list of abbreviations
# separated by spaces, so for example you can say:
# SET LANGUAGE zh en ko
# phrase1 in zh = phrase1 in en = phrase1 in ko
# phrase2 in zh = phrase2 in en = phrase2 in ko
# etc (SET LANGUAGE applies to all subsequent lines up to
# the next SET LANGUAGE, and the default is your second
# language followed by your first language).

# If you want a prompt word to be in the same language as
# the target word, use for example "set language zh zh"
# where the 2nd column is the prompt phrase and the 1st
# column is the target word.

# ---- Speech synthesis options ------------

# eSpeak (if available) will be preferred for the following languages
# (for other languages it's used only if there is no other voice)
# (set this to "" if you don't want to prefer eSpeak for any language)

prefer_espeak = "en"

# eSpeak is bundled with the Windows and Mac versions of Gradint
# and can be downloaded at http://espeak.sourceforge.net/
# Any of eSpeak's languages can be used as long as you use the
# same language abbreviations as eSpeak does, e.g. "en" for English,
# "zh" for Zhongwen (Mandarin).
#    - You can improve eSpeak's English by installing
#    Festival's dictionary and using lexconvert to convert
#    it, see http://people.pwf.cam.ac.uk/ssb22/gradint/lexconvert.html
#    (this has already been done in the bundled version).
#    - eSpeak is not very natural-sounding, but it is very
#    clear and accurate in English and some other languages

# WINDOWS VOICES: Gradint can use Microsoft SAPI 5, which is
# included with Windows XP+ and can be added to earlier versions.
# You can choose which SAPI voices to use here:

sapiVoices = {
# Add them in this format but without the # at the beginning:
    # "language abbrev" : ("full voice name", rate),
# For example, if you have "ScanSoft Mei-Ling_Full_22kHz"
# (which reads most Chinese hanzi quite well, but can't read
# pinyin and sometimes glitches so be careful), you can have
    # "zh" : ("ScanSoft Mei-Ling_Full_22kHz", 22050),
# or if you have Loquendo Lisheng (which has prosody reminiscent
# of an Italian-Chinese bilingual, and can pronounce pinyin
# with tone numbers as long as you add punctuation at the end)
# you can have
    # "zh" : ("Lisheng", 16000),
# or for Ekho Cantonese you can have:
    # "zhy"     : ("Ekho Cantonese", 8000), # or 16000 for v4.5+
    # "zhy-yue" : ("Ekho Cantonese", 8000), # ditto
    # "cant"    : ("Ekho Cantonese", 8000), # ditto
# or if you have other voices in other languages, you can
# use them too.  Note that FULL voice names must be used,
# exactly as they are shown in the Control Panel under Speech.
# (You may set 'rate' to 0 for the default of 44100.)
# Note: if you set an "en" voice here, and eSpeak is also
# on the system, remember to remove 'en' from "prefer_espeak" above.
# If you don't set an "en" voice but "en" is not in prefer_espeak,
# then the voice set in Control Panel will be used for English.
# If you have Neospeech Lily then that will be used for Chinese ('zh') unless
# overridden here (although Lily is not always accurate).
# (can use pinyin with tone numbers, 5 for neutral tone, v or u: for u-umlaut
#  and if possible put spaces between meaningful words; can also use hanzi)
}

sapiSpeeds = {
# Here you can change the speeds of SAPI voices.  Speed ranges from
# -10 (slowest) to +10 (fastest).  For example, to slow down the
# English SAPI voice and speed up the Chinese, you can have
# "en": -5, "zh": +3   (but without the # at the beginning)
}

# MAC OS X VOICES: you can set which voices to use here (if you set
# more than one voice for a language then the first available one is
# used; if you don't set a voice for a language then the first detected
# voice supporting that language is used, unless there's only English
# voices on the system in which case the one set in System Preferences
# is used).  Non-English voices might not work on older OS X versions.

# Note: if you want the "en" voice to be used, and eSpeak is also
# on the system, remember to remove 'en' from "prefer_espeak" above.

macVoices = {
"en":"Emily Daniel Alex Vicki",
"zh":"Ting-Ting", # OS 10.7+, can read hanzi, pinyin+tone numbers (5 for neutral) and English
"cant":"Sin-Ji", # OS 10.7+
"jp":"Kyoko", # OS 10.7+ ("ja" will auto-detect, but we're adding the alias "jp")
"ind":"Damayanti", # OS 10.7+ ("id" will auto-detect: we're adding "ind")
}

# For Mandarin Chinese, you can also use Yali Cheng's syllables
#   (see instructions on website) - recommended.
#   Language abbreviation must be 'zh'; text should use Hanyu Pinyin with
#   a tone number after each syllable and v or u: for u-umlaut
#   (and if possible put spaces between meaningful words but
#   not between syllables within a word).  You can also include hanzi
#   if eSpeak is present.
# There are also Cantonese syllables you can download similarly.

# For Cantonese you can also use Cameron Wong's Ekho program if installed
# (language abbreviation 'cant' or 'zh-yue' or 'zhy')
# You can set Ekho's speed from -50 to +100 (percent, default 0) here:
ekho_speed_delta = 0
# (Note: If this is not 0, Ekho will be preferred over partials.)

# ANDROID: set the language of your system's default voice
# (the SL4A module that Gradint uses can't find out for you)
# - normally "en", but some China-modified Android phones
# should set this to "zh" and avoid using pinyin (however I
# have not been able to actually test if SL4A can correctly
# pass a Unicode string to their synths, so perhaps it should
# be set to None and ensure you have recorded prompts)
systemVoice = "en"

# OTHER ENGLISH SYNTHESIZERS (language abbreviation must be "en"):
#
#    - Festival Lite on Windows (if all else fails) :
#      put flite.exe in the gradint folder
#
#    - Linux: install Festival, or flite if you want a US accent
#
#    - S60: the phone's built-in speech can be used
#
#    - RISC OS: if for some reason you can't install eSpeak
#      as mentioned above, you can instead install an older
#      version of Jonathan Duddington's !Speak, or the even
#      older "Speech!" utility.  These can be used only for
#      playing in real-time, not for generating files.

# You can also set extra_speech to a list of
# (language prefix, command), for example:
# extra_speech=[ ("la","say-latvian"),("de","say-german") ]
# This will take priority over other speech systems.
# The commands must be available and must take a text string
# on the command line.  You will not be able to use these
# when the output is going to a sound file.
# YOU DO NOT NEED TO SET THIS if your speech synthesizer is
# supported by default.

extra_speech = []

# If you have speech software which can take a text string
# and output it to a file, you can list that here.  Each
# element of the list should be of the form:
# ("la","command with %s for text","resulting filename")
# (generally best to use wav, but mp3 is also supported on
#  some systems; see note at end of samples/README)
# The %s argument will already be quoted for the shell if applicable.

extra_speech_tofile = []

# Another thing you can do is to selectively override the
# speech synthesis of certain words.  To do this, set
# synthCache (below) to a directory, and in that directory
# put the words you want to selectively override, with
# filenames of the form text_languagename.wav
# (e.g. hello_en.wav) in lower case.  gradint will use these
# files whenever possible, and will fall back to using
# speech synthesis.  (If a speech synthesizer is not
# available then gradint will leave out any words that are
# not covered by the files in the cache - this might be
# useful if you want to synthesize words on one machine and
# run gradint on another, see samples/utils/cache-synth.py.)
# ('utils' is called 'advanced utilities' on Win/Mac.)  If the
# text contains characters that your operating system will
# not allow in filenames, then you can make a TRANS.TBL file
# inside the synthCache directory (the first word of each
# line is the real filename and the rest of the line is the
# filename that you want gradint to see).
# On RISC OS, try not to include spaces in any of the real
# filenames, because RISC OS Python can't always cope.

synthCache = ""

# mp3 is also supported in synth-cache on some systems, but
# see the section "IMPORTANT NOTES ABOUT MP3" in
# samples/README.txt.  mp3-encoding the existing
# synth-cache files without adjusting TRANS.TBL is ok.

# If you are using eSpeak, you can use SSML for emphasis
# and for embedding another language in a sentence
# e.g. <voice name="en">some English</voice>
# but note that in vocab.txt this can only be done in
# the LAST column, otherwise the '=' will be treated as
# a column separator.  (So you need to use a 'set language'
# command to put the columns into an appropriate order
# so you can put the SSML commands in the last one.)

# If you set synthCache_test_mode below to 1, then the files
# in the synthCache directory will still be used but they
# will be interleaved with calls to the synth (if
# available).  You can use this to compare a new synth with
# the one you used to make the cache.  (It can also be set
# to a list of search terms that gradint should try to avoid
# sending to the new synth, and if the Python 're' library
# is present then they can be regular expressions.)

synthCache_test_mode = 0

# If you want to do the reverse, i.e. use a synth (or partials,
# see below) by default but sometimes substitute synthCache words
# for comparison, then add a _ character at the start of their
# filenames (or TRANS.TBL entries), e.g. _someWord_en.mp3
# - Gradint will use these files more sporadically.

# The GUI has functions for managing the cache which appear when
# you enter or select a cached word.  "Reject from cache" means
# rename it to __rejected_<word> (where 'word' is the word) which
# you can truncate or delete later.  There are also cache-related
# utilities in the utils directory.

# If you set justSynthesize (below, or on the command line -
# see end of this file for notes about the command line),
# gradint will not run normally but will JUST synthesize the
# words you specify in the language you specify.  This may
# be useful for setting up reminder scripts etc using the
# synthesizers and sound devices that you have already got
# working for gradint.  (Audio reminders in your second
# language are good practice.)  The first word should be the
# language abbreviation; the rest should be the text
# (e.g. "en Hello there" or "zh da4jia1 hao3") You can use
# the '#' character as a separator for a list, and numbers
# can be used for pauses (in seconds), e.g.
# "en Time's up in one minute.#60#en Time's up."
# (i.e. say "Time's up in one minute" in English, wait 60
# seconds, and say "Time's up" in English).  If the number
# is negative then the time is counted from the START
# (rather than the end) of the previous speech, which may
# help in situations where greater accuracy is important.
# You can also specify a pathname to a file to
# be played, e.g. "en starting#/path/to/somefile.wav#en finished"
# (.mp3 is also supported on some systems - see note in samples/README.txt)
# as long as there are no spaces in the pathname.
# You can add shell commands by starting with "sh: "
# e.g. "en starting command#sh: command#en command finished"
# (commands are assumed to take 0 time for scheduling purposes;
# if they take longer then subsequent delays are cut to make up).
# You can also specify R to repeat the speech continuously
# until interrupted, e.g. 'en critical error#5#R'.  Otherwise,
# if you add a * character to the end of the string of text
# then gradint will also run normally after doing this (but with
# waitBeforeStart = 0).  Note: If you need to put the
# reminder words into synthCache then try using
# samples/utils/cache-synth.py after listing them in vocab.txt with no
# prompts (if they have no prompts and are not marked as
# poetry then they will not be used in the lesson but will
# still be generated by samples/utils/cache-synth.py).
# If you set justSynthesize to "-" (a single hyphen)
# then Gradint will enter a simple loop that asks for
# words to synthesize from the terminal (this is the
# default when the collection is empty and no GUI can run).
# Note: If using justSynthesize="-" on Unix,
#    gradint "justSynthesize='-'" < <(command)
# is easier to interrupt with Ctrl-C than
#    command | gradint "justSynthesize='-'"

justSynthesize = ""

# If you're using Neospeech Lily (which I don't
# recommend because it can be inaccurate about tones etc)
# then you can set its location here if you've
# installed it to somewhere other than the default:
# note you need to put \\ for every \
lily_file = "C:\\Program Files\\NeoSpeech\\Lily16\\data-common\\userdict\\userdict_chi.csv"
# (the version sold in Asia might have it
# somewhere under C:\Program Files\VW\VT\Lily\M16-SAPI5\lib\
# but I don't know exactly)

# If you want to use SAPI under WINE in Linux
# then you can set ptts_program:
ptts_program = None
# (hint: run winecfg and set Windows version to Millenium (ME)
# before installing speechsdk51.exe and the voices; you
# can change home directory before running WINE if you want.)
# example: ptts_program="HOME=$HOME/sapi wine ptts.exe"
# (you will need to get ptts.exe, e.g. from Windows Gradint)
# Note: Depending on your WINE version, you might find it
# works only for English.  See samples/utils/synth-batchconvert-helper.py
# for an alternative.

# ---- Speech synthesis from "partials" ---

# You can set partialsDirectory below.  This is
# used for concatenative speech synthesis using your own
# speech units.  (If a word or phrase cannot be built from
# your own units, Gradint will fall back to another speech
# synthesizer.)

partialsDirectory = "partials"

# If that directory exists, it should contain a subdirectory
# for each language you want to do concatenative synthesis
# in.  Each of those should contain other subdirectories,
# one for each "voice".  For example, partials/zh/voice1
# (Gradint will choose the first voice that has the
# necessary units for the phrase it is trying to say).
# Each voice directory should contain files named like
# syllable-s.wav or syllable-m.wav or syllable-e.wav
# where s, m or e denote whether the syllable was taken
# from the start, middle or end of a phrase (which affects
# voicing).  You can also put more than one syllable in a
# file if you wish.  i/m/f (initial/mid/final) are acceptable
# aliases for s/m/e.  The s/m/e can also be followed by a
# number or other text so as to have multiple versions of
# each (but currently only one of these will be used).
# If no "-" is present, "-m" is currently assumed.
# You can cut the syllable from the recording using
# Audacity or a similar tool; try to make sure that there
# is no silence or other noise either side of it.
# MP3 files are also acceptable (see note at end of samples
# readme file), but beware that the MP3 encoder will add
# extra silence at the start (and possibly end) of the file
# and this will be noticable when the units are concatenated.

# In the language 'zh', gradint will re-write 3rd tones
# appropriately (if specified as pinyin with tone numbers)
# and will avoid using this method for any phrases that
# contain two or more consecutive tone 1's as this can be
# particularly poor-sounding when using this method,
# unless you've pitch-calibrated your files, in which
# case you can add a file called !calibrated to the voice
# directory to let gradint know consecutive tone 1's are OK.
# One way to pitch-calibrate the tone 1's is to download
# praat from www.praat.org and use a script like this:
# (works in praat v5.0.2, NOT v5.1.29)
# for N in *1*.wav; do echo "Read from file... $N"; echo "Change gender... 75.0 600.0 1.0 250 1.0 1.0"; echo "nowarn Write to WAV file... $N"; echo "Remove"; done > temp.praat ; praat temp.praat
# replacing 250 with the frequency of an average tone 1
# (don't worry about the function being called "change gender"; the
# parameters here are set to change the pitch but not the gender)
# (you can check your frequency guess by choosing a typical
# syllable and doing something like
# play syllable.wav ; play syllable.wav synth sine 250
# and revise the number up or down until the synth sounds
# at the same pitch as the syllable.  For female voices it
# could be anything from about 180 to 300+, male voices lower.)
# (If you have over 1000 files to normalise then you may need
# to modify that command to run praat separately on each file
# rather than on all the files at once.)
# You may want to do a similar thing to raise the pitch of tone 5
# (the "neutral tone" or qingshen) - if you save the higher-pitched
# versions as tone 6, Gradint will use these when a tone 5 follows a
# tone 3, or when ma5 follows tone 3, 4 or 5.
# (Lowering/shortening/softening tone 1 may work better than raising tone 5)

# Note: On Windows/Mac, Gradint can have trouble concatenating the partials
# quickly enough even if they are in WAV format.  You can create a file
# partials/header.wav (containing a wav header that specifies the sample
# rate and an unknown length) and all the other files should be *.raw and
# are raw data that is added to the end of this header.wav.
# You can also put a header.wav in an individual voice directory
# if its *.raw files have a different sample rate from those of
# the other voices (but still put a default header.wav in partials).
# If you don't like having so many *.raw files in a directory
# then you can also do (in a Unix evironment such as OSX or Cygwin) :
# wc -c *.raw | grep -v total$ | sed -e 's/^ *//' > audiodata.dat && cat *.raw >> audiodata.dat && rm *.raw

# You can also store syllables using UTF-8 filenames, but some systems may
# have difficulty storing all of these (especially for Korean); therefore
# you can use Unicode escaping in filenames, e.g. _ud79d for Unicode D79D
# (equivalent to UTF-8 sequence ED 9E 9D).  Example conversion command:
# for N in *; do cp "$N" "/path/to/fat/$(python -c "print repr('$N'.decode('utf-8'))[2:-1].replace(r'\\u','_u')")";done

# When using partials, you can change the length of pause
# between phrases by changing the following (in seconds) :
betweenPhrasePause = 0.3
# (Note it might pause for longer than that when playing in
# real-time on certain systems)

# You can also set partials_are_sporadic to 1, if you
# want partials to be used more sporadically, instead of at
# every opportunity.  This might be useful if you have a
# fluent-but-sometimes-unclear synthesizer and
# clear-but-not-fluent partials and you wish to mostly use the
# synthesizer but introduce partials as a secondary thing to check it
# (a bit like the inverse of sporadic synthCache and synthCache_test_mode).
partials_are_sporadic = 0

# Another function is to have multiple variants of a voice,
# for example yali and yali-low.  If you use hyphen and suffix
# like -low, Gradint will offer that option in the GUI.  You can
# set a default in voiceOption below (blank is normal, or set to "-low" etc)
voiceOption = ""

# ------- GUI "preset collections" buttons ---------

# If you are giving gradint to your students then you might
# want to bundle it with a pre-made vocabulary collection.
# If this collection is large then it might be good to let
# the student choose which sections to learn first.
# You can have them do that within the GUI:
# 1.  Put each section in its own directory (as recorded words or .txt
# files).  Name each directory with a name that ends with exclude_from_scan
# (default "_disabled"), e.g. unit1words_disabled, extraWords_disabled, etc.
# 2.  If any words are to be added to vocab.txt by a section, then create
# a file add-to-vocab.txt in that directory, with the contents (you'd better
# include a SET LANGUAGE command).  (You don't have to do this; you could
# just have sampled words and/or words in .txt files.)
# 3.  If any files are to be added to the student's prompts directory, these
# can be placed in an add-to-prompts subdirectory of each section (useful if
# the student already has a gradint installation and you're adding more presets).
# Similarly, if any language abbreviations are to be added to the student's
# otherLanguages and possible_otherLanguages variables, these can be listed
# in a file called add-to-languages.txt (separated by spaces) in each section.
# 4.  Create a file short-description.txt for each section.  This should be
# very short because it will be displayed on a button in the GUI.
# 5. Optionally create long-description.txt for some sections.  This will be
# displayed in a yes/no box asking the user to confirm their addition.
# 6. Put all those _disabled directories into the user's samplesDirectory (or
# drag into the recorded words folder and restart gradint).  You can also
# put them in the directory above, to avoid confusing any users who open
# "recorded words".
# (If you're a developer and have downloaded the Gradint build environment,
# you can make a version of Gradint's installation files that bundles your
# presets, by placing the _disabled directories into Gradint's build
# directory before typing "make".)

max_extra_buttons = 12
# - this setting limits the number of "add pre-made collection" buttons that
# are displayed on the screen at one time.  Set it to 0 to disable this feature.

# ---- Website options ---

mp3web = ""
mp3webName = ""

# If you use a website that lets you download
# MP3 or WAV pronunciations of words, you can use this from
# within the Gradint GUI by setting the above like this:
# mp3web = "http://www.example.com/search/$Word/$Lang"
# mp3webName = "Example"
# ($Word is replaced by the word to look for, and
# $Lang by the language code)

# Also you need to tell Gradint where to look for your browser's
# downloaded files.  The following directories will be tried:

downloadsDirs = ["../Downloads","..\\Desktop"]

# If you then tell Gradint to use an MP3 file you have downloaded,
# Gradint will store it in the synth cache (see below).

# If you set downloadsDirs = []
# then Gradint will not check for downloaded files, but will just
# point the browser to the site.  This might be useful for situations
# when you just want to check if words are there or not.

# ---- Options for outputting lessons to sound files and adding comments ------

# Sometimes it is useful to get gradint to output a lesson
# to a sound file instead of playing it directly, for
# example if you want to listen to it on a mobile device.
# To do this without using the GUI, change the value of
# outputFile (below) to a filename, e.g. outputFile = "myfile.mp3"

outputFile = ""

# Depending on the extension you specify, you will need a
# copy of LAME (for MP3), TooLame (for MP2), oggenc (for
# OGG), neroAacEnc or faac (for AAC) or speexenc (for SPX).
# On Windows put the .exe in the gradint folder; on other systems
# put the binary in either the gradint folder or the PATH.
# You will also need "sox" (you may already have this).

# The Gradint GUI will offer to export to files of any
# type that it can find encoders for, plus WAV.  So for
# example if it finds lame, it will give an MP3 option.
# On Windows it can use Windows Media Encoder to make WMA,
# if you installed this before Microsoft withdrew it in 2010.
# On Mac it can make AAC files using afconvert (10.5+ should have this).

# In each case Gradint uses encoding parameters that have been
# found to give good compression without sacrificing too
# much quality for a language-learning application.

# You can also specify .wav, .cdr, .au, etc (only sox is required)
# but it will be very large.  .wav might be your best option if you
# want to use a non-commandline music compressor.  .cdr is useful
# for making old-style audio CDs.

# gradint can also output to .sh (shell-script) files,
# which, when run, produce wav audio on their standard
# output for redirecting to an audio encoder or player.
# These shell-script files store each sample only once and
# without changing its rate, which means they can be
# generated very quickly even on a machine with no
# floating-point processor such as an NAS device.  They do
# however require sox and floating point at runtime, because
# the pipe to stdout means they all need to be converted to
# one rate, but if you're piping to an audio encoder then
# you probably need more floating-point for that anyway.
compress_SH = False
# - set that to True to make the .sh file smaller at the
# expense of quality.  (Does not include (g)zip compression;
# you can do that separately.)

# If you specify no extension then gradint will output raw
# samples.  If outputFile is "-" then gradint will send the
# raw samples to the standard output for use in a pipe.
# (You still need sox even for raw samples.)  Additionally,
# you can specify "-" as a filename followed by any of the
# above extentions, in which case gradint will write to its

# Set ask_teacherMode (below) to 1 to enable a rather
# experimental "teacher assistant mode" designed to help
# language teachers to use graduated-interval timings
# in a class.  Instead of playing the lesson, Gradint
# will tell you when each word is due, and you can choose
# whether to say it yourself or have the computer say it.
# Gradint can adapt to some timing fluctuations, but quick
# reactions are usually needed.  However Gradint does
# display the next word in advance and give a countdown.
# It's probably better to use keyboard shortcuts or a
# touch screen, not a mouse.

# in future)

# If you set logFile (below) to anything other than None, gradint
# will try to create a log containing the time at which each
# word is played.  This can be useful if you have a separate
# way of logging the time at which you had some trouble
# (make sure to synchronize with the computer's clock first).
# (When writing to an output file, the times are in minutes and
# seconds from the start of the file, but when playing in
# real-time, actual clock time can be logged.)
# (Note: Following the log while listening to the lesson
# may distract you from the audio.  It can however be useful if
# you need to check something afterwards, especially if you are
# going over lots of very old words.)

# You can set the default number of seconds that the lesson will be
# interrupted when you press "Brief interrupt".  Don't make this too
# big, though - Gradint will DROP any graduated-interval sequences that

# will reflect this.)  The same thing will happen if Gradint is
# delayed for other reasons, like Unix process signalling (Ctrl-Z stuff).

# (note: if you change samplesDirectory, promptsDirectory will NOT
# automatically change with it.  This is so that with samples/utils/email-lesson.sh
# you can set samplesDirectory to some subset of your collection and still
# have the main promptsDirectory.)

progressFile = "progress.txt"
progressFileBackup = "progress.bak" # or None
pickledProgressFile = "progress.bin"
# (pickledProgressFile is used only on platforms that support it.  It is
# quicker and takes less memory to load.  The text progressFile is still there
# and will be used if manually updated, i.e. time stamp newer than pickledProgressFile.)

gui_output_directory = "output"
# You can also set that to a LIST of directories, e.g.
# gui_output_directory = ["/path/to/MP3/player", "output"]
# in which case the first directory that EXISTS will be used
# (or the last one on the list if all else fail).
# Useful if the directory to your MP3 player only appears when
# it's plugged in for example.  With Linux automounters you can
# set "/media/*" as one of the directories, and it will expand to
# whatever removable device is mounted IF there is only one.

# See README.txt in the samples directory for what these mean:
limit_filename = "!limit"   # do not specify an extension
intro_filename = "_intro"   # ditto
poetry_filename = "!poetry" # ditto
variants_filename = "!variants" # ditto
exclude_from_scan = "_disabled"
exclude_from_coverage = "z_try_again" # not counted in "covered .. of .."

userNameFile="username.txt"
# userNameFile stores the user's name in the GUI (which has limited support
# for multiple students, e.g. for a single-user machine in use by a family).
# Set it to "" to disable this feature.

import_recordings_from = [r"\My Documents", r"\Storage Card\My Documents", r"\Ramdisk\My Documents"]
# This is really for Windows Mobile, but can also be adapted
# for other platforms.  If you leave Recording1.wav, Recording2.wav
# etc in any of the above directories, Gradint will offer to "import"
# them when you make a lesson.  Record the second-language words
# into odd-numbered files, and their first-language meanings
# into even numbered files.
# This can be useful to catch words with the Notes app on a PocketPC
# (which saves its recordings to \My Documents by default).

# ------- GUI translation (localisation) dictionary --------

# The format of this is:
# {"en phrase A":{"laX":u"language X translation", "laY":"language Y translation", ...}, "en phrase B":{...}, ...}
# UTF-8 encoding should be used.
# You can specify alternative scripts for one language with variation numbers (e.g. zh=Simplified Chinese zh2=Traditional Chinese)
# in which case you should set an @variants option listing their names
# e.g. "@variants-zh":[u"simplified",u"traditional"]
# Known bug: After pressing "Change languages", Gradint has to be restarted for *all* GUI messages to update.
# (Note: These translations will NOT be used on versions of Mac OS that might have TkInter Unicode display problems.)

# scripts to handle these)
# If soundVolume is not 1, only wavPlayer will be used.

# On non-Windows systems (or on Windows if you are running

# Limitation: If the lesson is cut short or interrupted, the *complete* lesson
# will be saved by saveLesson but only the *partial* progress will be saved
# to progressFile.  If you then use loadLesson and play it completely,
# Gradint is not currently able to reflect this fact in progressFile (and
# probably wouldn't be able to if progressFile has since been changed anyway).
